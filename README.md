Fashion Recommendation System

Developed a fashion recommendation system utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to suggest similar fashion items based on image content.

Tools & Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL, Scipy.

Key Metrics:
Image Dataset: Processed and analyzed 197 images from a ZIP archive.

Feature Extraction: Utilized VGG16 pre-trained model for feature extraction;
Recommendation Accuracy: Achieved a high relevance in recommendations by evaluating image similarity using cosine distance.

Process:
Data Extraction: Unzipped and organized fashion images for analysis.
Preprocessing: Standardized image inputs to 224x224 pixels and normalized feature vectors.
Feature Extraction: Extracted and normalized image features using VGG16.
Recommendation Engine: Implemented a recommendation algorithm to match and suggest similar fashion items, displaying results using Matplotlib.
Demonstrated proficiency in implementing machine learning models for practical applications and effectively visualizing results to facilitate user experience.

Visualization and User Interaction: Used Matplotlib and PIL for displaying input and recommended images. Created interactive dashboards and visualizations with Tableau to provide insights into fashion trends, recommendation performance, and user engagement metrics, improving user experience and system transparency.
